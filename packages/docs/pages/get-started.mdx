# Get Started

## Requirements

- A Vercel account to deploy the services.
- A PostgreSQL instance to be used as data storage.

## Manual Deployment

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone TODO
```

<Callout>
  You will also need the [Vercel CLI](https://vercel.com/cli) to deploy the
  services on the edge network.
</Callout>

### Backend Service

In the main repository the backend service can be found at `packages/backend`.
All you need to do is to run the following command:

```bash
cd packages/backend && vercel
```

The CLI will ask you some questions to configure the service, here's an example
with all the answers:

```bash
Vercel CLI 24.0.0
? Set up and deploy “~/projects/aurora/packages/backend”? [Y/n] y
? Which scope do you want to deploy to? John Doe
? Link to existing project? [y/N] n
? What’s your project’s name? aurora-backend
? In which directory is your code located? ./
No framework detected. Default Project Settings:
- Build Command: `npm run vercel-build` or `npm run build`
- Output Directory: `public` if it exists, or `.`
- Development Command: None
? Want to override the settings? [y/N] n
```

Once the service is running, you need to configure the following
[environment variables](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/projects/environment-variables):

- **JWT_SECRET** - The secret used to sign the JWT tokens.
- **DATABASE_URL** - The URL of the PostgreSQL instance.

<Callout>
  A redeployment of the service is required after changing the environment
  variables.
</Callout>

### Frontend Service

In the main repository the frontend service can be found at `packages/frontend`.
All you need to do is to run the following command:

```bash
cd packages/frontend && vercel
```

The CLI will ask you some questions to configure the service, here's an example
with all the answers:

```bash
Vercel CLI 24.0.0
? Set up and deploy “~/projects/aurora/packages/frontend”? [Y/n] y
? Which scope do you want to deploy to? John Doe
? Link to existing project? [y/N] n
? What’s your project’s name? aurora-frontend
? In which directory is your code located? ./
Auto-detected Project Settings (Create React App):
- Build Command: react-scripts build
- Output Directory: build
- Development Command: react-scripts start
? Want to override the settings? [y/N] n
```

Once the service is running, you need to configure the following
[environment variables](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/projects/environment-variables):

- **REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL** - The URL of the backend service.

<Callout>
  A redeployment of the service is required after changing the environment
  variables.
</Callout>

## Run the Database Migrations

The last operation needed to get the services running is to run the database
migrations. You can do it following these steps:

- Open the terminal and navigate to the `packages/backend` directory.
- Make a copy of the `.env.example` file and rename it to `.env`.
- Fullfill the `.env` file with the DATABASE_URL environment variable.
- Run the following command:

```bash
npm run db:migrate
```

All the migrations will be run and the database will be populated with the
schema.

<Callout>
  I know this process is a bit weird, currently it's the only way i know to
  migrate a new schema.
</Callout>
